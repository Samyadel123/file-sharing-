# project objective 
this a simple file sharing system that allows users to upload files and share them with others.
# project components 
- frontend: plane html, css, js that is going to be hosted on s3 bucket
- backend : a simple fastapi app that is going to be hosted on ec2 instance
# challenges that we faced 
- our github is private and it won't clone on any machine other than our own so we had to use ssh key generated by the server and add it to our github account
- the frontend and backend we communicated probably that's because of a problem called CORS more info at (this link)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS] 
- the deployment was not an easy task how can we protect our ec2 so we used nginx as a reverse proxy and also because it made deployment easier (no need to change host or other settings)
- also making sure that the app run as expected we used uv something like cargo in the rust world to make sure it run as expected on the server
